# Become Thumb One

## Description
Become Thumb One is a website where the user has the opportunity to complete four different tasks in an attempt to "become thumb one."

## Reason
This is my submission for the GatsbyJS [Silly Site Challenge](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/silly-site-challenge/). I decided to participate in the challenge in order to:
- improve my familiarity with the Gatsby framework
- continue coding on a daily basis as I am currently in the process of finding my first developer job
- practice building another website
- have fun - silly sites are the best!

## Learning outcomes
While working on Become Thumb One, I learned/practiced the following:
- <em>Web accessibility.</em> This was relatively new territory for me. I have been aware of its importance for some time, but have never really delved into what is needed to make a website accessible to everyone. I still feel a bit shaky on the subject, but this project kickstarted my knowledge and awareness on the topic. The entire site can be maneuvered with a keyboard.
- <em>Modals and react-modal.</em> I spent a solid chunk of time reading about modals and how to trap the focus within an opened modal. Initially I attempted to build my own reusable modal component from scratch, but ultimately decided to use [react-modal](https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal) for all the modals on the site.
- <em>Project structure.</em> The project file structure for this site differs from how I have structured past projects. I decided to separate related files into directories based on the site's pages. While maybe not optimally organized, I felt much more organized than I usually do while working on a project.
