    title: 'Snow Beetle',
    text: `Over the long weekend I decided to drive north to visit my sister. The drive was fine. I got lost once, and the kid riding with me didn't really like that much. Too bad. Anyway, I made it to my sister's place and the weather was really bummy. It was winter and there was quite a deep coating of snow, being up in the north and all. What did we decide to do? We decided to go rent some snowshoes at the nearby rental shop and climb up a mountain. The mountain ended up being more of a hill. That was fine. It just made the experience that much more strange. The sun was no where to be seen. In fact, there was a heavy fog that afternoon. So we parked at the hill, got out of the car, and put on our snowshoes. The snow came down sporadically. Off we went. There was nothing but white all around us. White in the air, white on the ground. White in front of us, and white behind us. After what felt like hours of wandering, we paused. That's when I saw him. The snow beetle. There, on the white hill, miles from any visible vegetation, was a black beetle crawling atop the surface of the snow. I dropped to my hands and knees and watched his progress. I couldn't tell quite what type of journey he was on, but he kept moving. I was fascinated. Completely enthralled. Eventually I tore myself from the scene and we headed back down the hill. These days I find myself often wondering about the snow beetle and how his journey ended.`,

    title: 'The Consciousness Stream',
    text: `Maybe I should find something to eat right now because the dinner I am making has another two hours before it will be ready to eat. This is bad because it's already well into the evening. This project has made me work really hard. I like it. But I hope that I can find a job. I've been studying and practicing web development full time for the past two years and a few months. Surely I'm ready. I know I'm ready. After Christmas I am applying for jobs. Everything has been postponed due to the combination of our move, the pandemic, and the timing of the holidays. Ha ha. To say the timing of the holidays is funny because they are they same days each year. That is silly. Anyway, I have custard filled acorn squash in the oven. I'm really excited, but I'm nervous because it's a recipe I want to turn out well since it will be going on my blog. You should check out my blog. It's called Peel the Garlic. I post a new recipe on it every Tuesday. It's fun, but I sometimes feel stressed that I require myself to create and post a new recipe weekly. It's good for me. Bye.`,

    title: 'Running Through Sliding Doors',
    text: `When I was fifteen, my two best friends and I would regularly bike to a nearby grocery store. We were hooligans. We never did anything strictly illegal, but we were mischevious. Loitering was our game. We would stroll the store, soda in hand, bikes out front, and just pass Saturdays away like that. Sometimes we would buy cookie dough tubes to eat in the parking lot. Other times we'd buy twelve-packs of soda for the upcoming night of video games. On one particular day we decided it'd be fun to drive the motorized wheelchairs around the store. So we did. We didn't make it very far before a store manager spotted us. He headed our way. Freaked out with no idea of the potential punishments, we jumped off the wheelchairs and darted for the exit. With adrenaline running, we made it to the store exit, not slowing down one bit. The exit doors were automatic sliding doors. The automatic part was fine, but somehow we managed to forget that they were very slow. Our momentum took us through the doors before they had time to fully open and knocked one of the doors off it's track. Our adrenaline increased a full thirty notches, so we grabbed our scooters outside the store and pedaled our scooters as quickly as a teenage boy can. That's how we escaped the sliding doors.`,

    title: 'Holy Socks',
    text: `I have so many socks with holes. That worst part is that many of my socks are wearing through simultaneously. Over the past two weeks I have tossed more than a few socks to the recycling bin. Wait, do you know if you can actually recycle a sock? Anyway, the socks that are wearing through are actually my newest socks. Most of the socks that I obtained while in college are still great. What does this say about the state of the world? Is sock quality on the decline? If so, should I move to a more sandal-dominant collection of footwear. This doesn't work in the winter, so I may have to actually think about relocating. What I'm getting at is that socks can really affect the way you live your life. Don't forget that. If you've never taken a moment to consider the point I'm making, do so. Also, find your most loyal socks and thank them. That's all`,
